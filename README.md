# Advent of Code 2024 repository 

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges.

Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve a series of programming puzzles in a variety of languages.

# Challenges

The repository is organized by day, with each day's challenge and solution in a separate directory. The challenges range from simple programming puzzles to more complex problems that require creative problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

# Languages

The solutions are written in Python
